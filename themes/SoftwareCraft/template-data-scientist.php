				If you want to hire a data scientist for your next project, you must consider some important considerations. When you hire data scientists, they should meet or exceed the technical competency threshold. We should strive to create high-performance, high-functioning, flexible, adaptable and smart people, not just technically savvy people. Given the highly technical nature of data science, most professionals in this field are hired based on their expertise in statistics and modeling and their ability to use machine learning and other cutting-edge tools and technologies. Software craft has one of such high-performance data scientists, and they have a background in software engineering and computer science—they know how to program and code.<br><br></p>

				Most organizations should hire data scientists. Getting data scientist for hire as early as possible can help shape some of the requirements around data and analytics functions because they usually involve many business areas. Moreover, Data scientists understand your unique industry from the beginning, which means they can more easily understand and interpret data to make predictions-without you having to hire an external expert (or three experts).

				It depends on the nature of the product. To hire part time analyst remote from the agency, they will charge a fee based on the project and estimate the time and resources spent on your project. They look at the scope of the project, estimate the number of hours, and then multiply the number of hours by their hourly rate. They added a few hours of buffer time and sent quotes. However, data scientist freelance services can freely set rates based on their own experience. Freelance data analyst hourly rate in the market is $40/hour, while the high-end hourly salary may be as high as $300/hour or more! On average, the cost of a freelance data scientist rate will cost you $80/hour.
