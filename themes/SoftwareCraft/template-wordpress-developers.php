				Whether you want to hire WP developers for your team, or you have an important project in progress, you need a knowledgeable candidate who can meet things like writing custom code to enable custom features and functions, customize themes and plugins. If you do not find a specific plan for the best candidate, your company will compromise on its deliverables (project report, performance, and progress) and lose customer confidence in its development process.
