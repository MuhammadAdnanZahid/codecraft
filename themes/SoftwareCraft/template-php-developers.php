				  The software Development Process of the Software Craft
			  </p>
<p>
We have an exclusive team for you to hire PHP smarty developers who provide feature-rich and highly customized apps development. With years of experience and knowledge, we have the skills and expertise to provide you with innovative and scalable web applications to meet your changing business needs. The PHP coder for hire follows the following basic steps to develop your software:


         </p>
          
				<h4>
					<span style="color:#a1cc3a">01 - </span>Product Design
			  </h4>
<p>
When you hire dedicated PHP developers from us after experts start working over product designing. After the requirements analysis, we chose a development platform, such as .NET, Java, Laravel, Ruby on Rails or FileMaker. In addition, we designed the user interface and user experience of our application in this step. Considering the target users and main functions of the software application, a user-friendly and modern-looking user interface are designed. The product design layout is further used as the basis for the next step of the development cycle. In the next step involving coding, the development team must come up with a plan to implement the programming language.
			  </p>


<h4>
	<span style="color:#a1cc3a">02 - </span>Product Development
			  </h4>

<p>
After the product design phase, our PHP development team enters the coding and implementation phase. Once our development team has mastered the requirements specifications and design documents, software developers start programming. In addition to coding, developers also conduct unit or module testing at this stage in order to find potential problems as early as possible in the development stage. You can hire PHP coders of software crafts and outsourced coding activities. If you want to hire a PHP programmer in the UK or in the USA we have cheap solutions for you. You can outsource our best talent.

<section class="ftco-section mob-ftco-sec secscroll">

          <div class="row mob-case-row ">    
          <div class="col-md-12">
			    <h4>
	<span style="color:#a1cc3a">03 - </span>Testing
			  </h4>

<p>
After the coding and implementation steps, our team can conduct integration and verification tests. Our software development service team is in the process of continuously releasing different software applications for various purposes, so this process is necessary because the test product strongly supports all available parameters. This stage exposes potential errors in the product. Test the interaction between various modules and/or external systems here. After the integration test, a verification test will be performed to test the final software product based on the requirements and UI/UX design from the end user's perspective. In the end, experts run the final testing to decide the end product. If the PHP app no longer contains more (unacceptable) issues, then deploy the application.

         </p>
           
        
				 <h4>
	<span style="color:#a1cc3a">04 - </span>Product deployment
			  </h4>

<p>
We only hire a PHP development team that follows SDLC step by step. Once the PHP app passes the testing phase, the product is deployed. Once the product is ready, the first batch of products will be launched and open to the public. This is called Beta testing. If any changes are needed due to customer feedback, or any errors not found during the testing phase, they can be corrected and implemented during this PHP app development phase. Such a server can be one of the company's own servers, or it can be located in the "cloud" for maintenance and operation.

         </p>
			  
			   <h4>
	<span style="color:#a1cc3a">05 - </span>Maintenance
			  </h4>

<p>
Once all the above steps are successfully passed and the software product is fully put on the market, the product must remain operational and the product needs to be maintained. This involves fixing problems, hiring dedicated PHP developers to keep the system up to date with operating system patches, or using third-party software updates. If the user base of a software product increases significantly, it may need to be expanded in the form of additional processing power, memory and/or database capacity to keep the system running smoothly.
